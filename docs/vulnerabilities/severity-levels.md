## Introduction

Conviso Platform provides a breakdown of the vulnerabilities corresponding to each severity level.

## Usage

These levels delineate the evaluated degree of risk, spanning from **Critical, High, Medium, to Low**.

**Notification:** Refers to the absence of security controls of an application.

## How Conviso Platform Determines Severity Levels

The Conviso Platform follows the [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) standard to define severity. Still, we are continually checking the criticality of the actual impact of the vulnerability in a given scope, also considering the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss) standard.

## Severity levels and Priority

Prioritizing vulnerabilities is pivotal in ensuring that resources are efficiently allocated for effective vulnerability management. 

Prioritization of vulnerabilities depends on many factors, including your organization's context, technology environment, and the assets you own. However, as the Conviso Platform has all the information centralized, it is easier for you to prioritize!

By addressing **critical severity** vulnerabilities first and then those of lesser degree onwards, **focus on protecting your organization's most valuable or sensitive assets**.

**Note:** Align the prioritization with the organization's risk tolerance and security policies. Some vulnerabilities need immediate attention due to the organization's risk appetite.

Remember that prioritizing vulnerabilities is an ongoing and dynamic task. As new information about threats and vulnerabilities emerges, you may need to adjust your priorities to ensure your systems and data are effectively protected.

## Security Expert for questions 

If you have any questions or doubts about prioritizing or understanding vulnerabilities, you can use the Conviso Platform’s feature to communicate with a Security Expert.
