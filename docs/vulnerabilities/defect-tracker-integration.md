## Introduction
Defect Tracker is a tool that helps you track and manage software defects and issues. It allows you to create, assign, prioritize, and resolve defects in your software projects.
These tools can also be integrated with Conviso Platform, so you can streamline the vulnerability management process and improve the security of your applications.

## Conviso Platform Integrations
Our platform supports the following Defect Tracker integrations:

* [Bitbucket](/docs/integrations/bitbucket.md)
