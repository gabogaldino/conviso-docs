## Introduction 

This document provides some general guidance on resolving vulnerabilities in your software projects on Conviso Platform.

## Solution

To prevent vulnerabilities from occurring in the first place, you need to follow secure coding practices and apply security principles throughout the software development lifecycle. 

In the “**Description**” section, on a page of an identified vulnerability, you will find a summary under “**Solution**” of how the problem is solved in the code:

In the table, select the vulnerability you want to manage. A new screen will appear, exhibiting all projects where it was identified and more details:

## Learn how to prevent this

Conviso Platform offers seamless integration between training and practice, providing developers with the necessary skills to deal with identified application vulnerabilities efficiently.

Our _Just in Time Training_ approach allows you to choose training plans based on identified vulnerabilities, ensuring that you receive the training that makes the most sense for the code correction you need to apply.

To access this feature, on a specific vulnerability page, access "**Learn how to prevent this**" in the top menu:
