## Introduction
Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in software that attackers can exploit to compromise the security of your applications. 

As a developer, you must be aware of the vulnerabilities that affect your code and how to fix them before they cause harm. 

## Usage

In the table, select the vulnerability you want to manage. A new screen will appear, exhibiting all projects where it was identified and more details:

### First, understand what the vulnerability is and where it occurs in the code 

In “**Description,**” you have a summary of the vulnerability. Check in which file it occurs within the application in “**Occurrences,**” and in “**Solution,**” you will find the resolution for this problem.

If you want to understand the basis of all this material, access the links in "**References**".

In **“Details**” you can see the exact line of code where the vulnerability was detected, the “**Impact**” it can have on the business and also access “**Steps to Reproduce**” to understand how the attack works:

See the change history in “**Timeline**” to know what actions were taken previously to avoid rework:

### Make it clear that you will be working on this vulnerability "In Progress"

Now that you are familiar with the vulnerability, on the right side where the status is located, change it to “**In Progress.**” This will signal that a developer is fixing it.

**Note:** If you are integrated with any [Defect Tracker tool](/docs/vulnerabilities/defect-tracker-integration.md), updating the card status will directly impact the platform without making another change.

### Solution for the vulnerability to be implemented

To fix the vulnerability, you need to apply the “**Solution**” provided by the Conviso Platform recommendations in the panel on the left:

You can also click on “**Learn how to prevent this**” and study to understand in practice the vulnerability and how to avoid it in the future:

[![img](../../static/img/manage-vuln-img7.png 'Vulnerabilities on the Conviso Platform.')](https://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/web-interactives/public/v1/track/redirect?encryptedPayload=AVxigLKtcWzoFbzpyImNNQsXC9S54LjJuklwM39zNd7hvSoR%2FVTX%2FXjNdqdcIIDaZwGiNwYii5hXwRR06puch8xINMyL3EXxTMuSG8Le9if9juV3u%2F%2BX%2FCKsCZN1tLpW39gGnNpiLedq%2BrrfmYxgh8G%2BTcRBEWaKasQ%3D&webInteractiveContentId=125788977029&portalId=5613826)

To learn more about how to resolve a vulnerability, see this [documentation](/docs/vulnerabilities/resolution-guide.md).

### Wait for the validation of the security analyst “Awaiting Validation”

After implementing the solution, you must change the status to "**Awaiting Validation**." 

[![img](../../static/img/manage-vuln-img8.png 'Vulnerabilities on the Conviso Platform.')](https://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/web-interactives/public/v1/track/redirect?encryptedPayload=AVxigLKtcWzoFbzpyImNNQsXC9S54LjJuklwM39zNd7hvSoR%2FVTX%2FXjNdqdcIIDaZwGiNwYii5hXwRR06puch8xINMyL3EXxTMuSG8Le9if9juV3u%2F%2BX%2FCKsCZN1tLpW39gGnNpiLedq%2BrrfmYxgh8G%2BTcRBEWaKasQ%3D&webInteractiveContentId=125788977029&portalId=5613826)

Now, you can expect the validation of the security analyst, who will review your code and confirm if the vulnerability was resolved or not. Once it has been validated, the status will be changed to “**Fixed**”.

**Note:** If you are integrated with any [Defect Tracker tool](http://XX), updating the card status will directly impact the platform without making another change.
